# About this repository

The repository is almost all you need to recreate Archfinch. The missing parts are database data and server configuration.

You are free to explore the source code, reuse it in any way you see fit (MIT license, see LICENSE file) or contribute. I cannot guarantee that all code is top quality as Archfinch is coded in a "hacker" fashion, i.e. you want something done, you do it, no flowcharts or board meetings. I try to adhere to standards but it's not the highest priority.

You should be able to recreate Archfinch if you devote enough time to it. If there is ever nonzero demand, I will provide a detailed guide, but I doubt there will be any.
